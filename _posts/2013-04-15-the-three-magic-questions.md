## The Three Magic Questions

1. What do you want your users to do?
2. Where do you want them to go?
3. How do you want them to feel?

Your probably thinking, well duh! Allow me to explain why I'm starting our growth hacking series of blog posts with seemingly obvious questions. Let's break it down question by question.

### What do you want your users to do?

This is something that I think a lot of the times doesn't get much thought, the general idea is that everyone in the team already knows exactly what they want the user to do, in most cases it's just "use the product". But I don't think it's that simple.

For instance if your an online retailer your first instict might be: "Make a purchase, that's what we want them to do!".  Wrong, you will probably want to have your users "primed" before making the sell.  This can be as simple as viewing the reviews of a product or reading the testimonials of previous clients.  

### Where do you want them to go?

It might be tempting to get new users into your sales funnel as soon as possible, but it's probably going to end up killing your conversion rate. Why? Because they didn't have an opportunity to explore and compare, basically think through the purchase before pulling out their credit card. 

Not only do you need to account for what you want them to do initially, you need a plan in place for after they do that. So after buying a product, what next? Do you want them to share their purchase on facebook? Signup to an email newsletter? Leave and never come back? Probably not the latter, let's move on.

### How do you want them to feel?

Noone will remember your tagline or description, but they will remember how they felt.  Did you make them smile, or did you piss them off.  That's what matters. 

We will go over user experience in more detail in a later article, but for now just focus on ensuring you don't have any negative surprises (batteries not included).  People hate being tricked, so be up front and honest and reap the benefits of happy users.
