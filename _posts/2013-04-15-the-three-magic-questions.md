## The Three Magic Questions

1. What do you want your users to do?
2. Where do you want them to go?
3. How do you want them to feel?

Your probably thinking, well duh! Allow me to explain why I'm starting our growth hacking series of blog posts with seemingly obvious questions. Let's break it down question by question.

### What do you want your users to do?

This is something that I think a lot of the times doesn't get much thought, the general idea is that everyone in the team already knows exactly what they want the user to do, in most cases it's just "use the product". But I don't think it's that simple.

For instance if your an online retailer your first instict might be: "Make a purchase, that's what we want them to do!".  But is that really what you want your focus to be on when a new user lands on your site? Probably not. Before you get them to buy or perform your action your going to have to convince them that your trustworthy and can provide value.  Only once that's done will they actually do what you want them to.

Not only do you need to account for what you want them to do initially, you need a plan in place for after they do that. So after buying a product, what next? Do you want them to share their purchase on facebook? Signup to an email newsletter? Or leave and never come back? Probably not the latter, let's move on.

### Where do you want them to go?

It might be tempting to get new users into your sales funnel as soon as possible, but it's probably going to end up killing your conversion rate. Why? Because they didn't have an opportunity to explore and compare, basically think through the purchase before pulling out their credit card. 

A better user flow might be something like this:

1. User lands on site
2. User views product
3. User checks reviews
4. User adds product to cart
5. User compares a few similar products
6. User enters checkout funnel

### How do you want them to feel?

Noone will remember your tagline or description, but they will remember how they felt.  Did you make them smile, or did you piss them off.  That's what matters.
