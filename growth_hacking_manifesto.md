## What the fsck is growth hacking?

There's a lot of discussion about growth hacking in the technosphere right now. Startups are falling over themselves to hire these masters of user growth. Hell that's how I got hired at my current role at mashape and it's also why your here reading this.

Even though no one quite agrees on exactly what growth hacking exactly is, and that's a good thing, your not going to find a cookie cutter receipe to build sustainable user growth for your product. Things that worked for Facebook won't be what makes the next big social network overcome them.  After all it's all about innovation, not replication. While the methods a growth hacker might employ are always going to be different dependent upon your specific goals and userbase, the qualities and techniques of successful growth hackers have a lot in common.

A growth hacker is just a fancy word for internet marketer.  As Gary Vaynerchuk said at a keynote he gave last week "Growth hacking is just GET USERS!" that's the biggest part of growth hacking, building a large influx of new active users.  Notice I said active, the second part of growth hacking is to keep your current users engaged and interested in sticking around. Finally your goal should always be to make your users happy. Happy customers share the experience with their friends.

Growth hackers are a unique hybrid of coder and marketer, they don't have to beg engineering to implement javascript tracking and testing tools or pull up the latest data from the datastore. With the freedom of being able to do the whole process without barriers and obstacles in the way, successful growth hackers can try a lot of different things really fast.  And with good tools, they can measure and analyze what's working and not working. If you didn't bother looking at the table of contents above I'll be covering these tools in the third chapter, so make sure to [stay tuned](subscribelink).

####I'll just leave these quotes from the AD:tech growth hacking panel here.

>"Growth hacking is a cooler version of product marketing" - Christine, Intel

>"Solving problems with data." - I forget so I'll just elaborate on the quote. Test, analyize, deploy, repeat.

>"Innovate a non traditional way to make something happen." - Be bold and creative.

>"Changing how your product works to fit with the times." - Be fast and agile

>"Most critical is getting the right people into the funnel."  - [â€¦ at the right time] 

>"Hack biz dev. Hack marketing. Hack the norm." - It's an ethos and mantra that works everywhere

_Personal Note: take better notes._

###See you all next week when I share the three magic questions you need to be asking yourself now, always, and forever.

 

## The Three Magic Questions

1. What do you want your users to do?
2. Where do you want them to go?
3. How do you want them to feel?

Your probably thinking, well duh! Allow me to explain why I'm starting our growth hacking series of blog posts with seemingly obvious questions. Let's break it down question by question.

### What do you want your users to do?

This is something that I think a lot of the times doesn't get much thought, the general idea is that everyone in the team already knows exactly what they want the user to do, in most cases it's just "use the product". But I don't think it's that simple.

For instance if your an online retailer your first instict might be: "Make a purchase, that's what we want them to do!".  But is that really what you want your focus to be on when a new user lands on your site? Probably not. Before you get them to buy or perform your action your going to have to convince them that your trustworthy and can provide value.  Only once that's done will they actually do what you want them to.

Not only do you need to account for what you want them to do initially, you need a plan in place for after they do that. So after buying a product, what next? Do you want them to share their purchase on facebook? Signup to an email newsletter? Or leave and never come back? Probably not the latter, let's move on.

### Where do you want them to go?

It might be tempting to get new users into your sales funnel as soon as possible, but it's probably going to end up killing your conversion rate. Why? Because they didn't have an opportunity to explore and compare, basically think through the purchase before pulling out their credit card. 

A better user flow might be something like this:

1. User lands on site
2. User views product
3. User checks reviews
4. User adds product to cart
5. User compares a few similar products
6. User enters checkout funnel

### How do you want them to feel?

Noone will remember your tagline or description, but they will remember how they felt.  Did you make them smile, or did you piss them off.  That's what matters.
